##How TO PLaY

To play our game you first need to know da way, then once you know the way you become knuckles.

To control knuckles you use the WASD keys.

To control the camera you can click and drag on the screen or use the arrow keys.

To jump just press the space key and boom you jump up in that air!

There isnt quite a Goal yet, however you can run around the map and look for powerups and see what they do to knuckles(you).
